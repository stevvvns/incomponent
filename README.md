# incomponent

## What?
This is a minimal component library that rips off most of Vue's composition API, and uses `lit-html` for rendering, `immer` for immutable state.

You get a setup function that gets called _once_ per component instance, so you don't have to worry about crap like the Rule of Hooks or memoizing everything.

You set up `ref`s to state, `derive` effects and calculated dependent `refs` from them, and then get reactive rendering by means of plain old functions. Without the use of proxies making `console.log` debugging horrible!

In return, you get native web components that can be dropped into any other framework or vanilla JS page.

## Why?
IDK. I like the name of the library. You have to pronounce it with the same stress and rhythm as "incompetent". You should use Vue instead if that's somehow not a compelling enough reason.

I was writing a little game in vanilla JS, and after getting tired of ersatz rendering functions I cobbled together only the things I liked from Vue to make `lit-html` work reactively. Maybe the set of things I like aligns with your taste?

## How?
`$ npm i @stevvvns/incomponent`

Consider a bare-bones components:

```javascript
import { comp, html, ref, derive } from '@stevvvns/incomponent';

export const scoreStore = (() => {
  const score = ref(0);
  const doubled = derive(() => score.value * 2);
  const increment = amount => score.value += amount;
  return { score, doubled, increment };
})();

// <inc-score>
comp(function Score() {
  const { score, doubled, increment } = scoreStore;
  const byAmount = ref(1);
  function add() {
	  byAmount.value += 1;
	  increment(byAmount.value);
  }
  return { score, doubled, add };
})
.template(el => html`
  <p>Score: <strong>${el.score}</strong> [${el.doubled}]</p>
  <p><button @click=${el.add}>More</button></p>
`);

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // yay native components, they're just HTML tags you can drop in anywhere
  document.body.innerHTML = `
    <inc-score></inc-score>
    <inc-controls></inc-controls>
  `;
});
```
This does about what you'd expect, gives you a button you can click to see two numbers go up. [`example.html`](./example.html) has a much more involved version of the same concept demonstrating more of the API.

### Concepts

#### `ref(value)`
* Creates a reference with a `.value` property initialized with the argument.
* Changing `.value` causes reactive updates in templates and derives that use the ref. (More on those below)
* Also provides `.mut(draft => { /* modify draft, or return a new version */ })` which sets the value to a new immutable version.
	* This useful if your value is an array or an object, and you want to modify it internally:
		```javascript
		const list = ref([]);
		derive(() => console.log(list.value.length));
		list.value.push(1); // same array! won't retrigger
		list.mut(draft => { draft.push(1) }); // new array, retriggers
		list.value = [...list.value, 1]; // also a new array, also retriggers
		```
	* Also prefer `mut()` when making more than one update to the same `ref`, like removing an array item and replacing it at a different index. `mut()` batches updates to the draft and avoids excessive retriggering.

#### `derive(callback, deps = [])`
 * Can derive a value by returning: `const double = derive(() => points.value * 2)`
 * Can derive an effect by not: `derive(() => console.log(points.value))`
 * Can do both at the same time if you're feeling spicy
 * If you return a value, it is a `ref`, and hence can be used in further derives
 * The callback is invoked once immediately, and then again any time the `ref`s it depends on change.
	 * Any `ref`s that you read the `.value` of the first time the callback is invoked are tracked as dependencies automatically
	 * If there are additional `ref`s you evaluate only conditionally, you can include them in the optional second argument to track them as well.
 
#### `comp(function SetupFunction() {})`
 * This is how you make a web component. It gets named by changing the function name to dash case, so don't use an arrow. This one becomes `<inc-setup-function>`
 * The function provided here is called once during the instantiation of each instance of your component.
	 * Your general goal here is to set up (hence "setup function") the mechanics of your component:
		 * `ref`s for state and props
		 * `derives` for calculations that would be awkward in the template
		 * regular old `function`s for state mutations
 * The return value of `comp`, which we'll call `builder`, is a collection of functions that can be called in any order (or not at all) to set the behavior of your component based on the setup:

#### ``builder.template(el => html`..`)``
 * HTML or SVG representation of your component's state
 * `el` is your web component instance, which has all the stuff you would expect on a native web component, but also notably anything you return from your setup function is bound as a property.
	 * `refs` are unwrapped during evaluation of the template. For example:
```javascript
	// auto-unwrapped
	html`<p>hello, ${el.name}</p>`
	// this will be evaluated later, still need to use .value
	html`<button @click=${() => console.log(el.name.value)}></button>`
```
 * A few of `lit-html`'s [directives](https://lit.dev/docs/templates/directives/) are re-exported by incomponent:
	 * `cx`, `sx` aliases for `classMap` and `styleMap` respectively, ergonomic helpers for setting `class` and `style` attributes using objects rather than interpolating strings.
	 * `unsafeHTML`, `unsafeSVG` for when/if you need raw access to write HTML, for example when rendering markdown like this.
	 * `repeat(items, keyFn, subtemplate)` an important utility to render dynamic lists into `<li>` or similar.
		 * `keyFn` returns a unique id for each item that `lit-html` can use to track the item during updates. If you render your `<li>` with a standard JS `items.map(...)` it may appear to work until the list changes and you find some properties of item A mashed up with item B because `lit-html` is making incremental updates to the DOM based on indices that have changed instead of tracking the items as distinct entities.
	 * You can add other directives by including `lit-html` as your own direct dependency 

#### ``builder.style(css`...`)``
 * Scoped styles contained to the element's shadow DOM

#### `builder.init(callback)`
 * This is called just after the template is first rendered into the DOM, so you can use it do things like DOM measurements, attaching observers, etc.
 * If you return a function from the callback, it will be registered as a cleanup function and called when the component is going to leave the DOM (e.g., to disconnect and dispose those observers)
